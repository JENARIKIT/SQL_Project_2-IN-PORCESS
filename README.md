Explanation:

1. Sales Revenue
   
Sales revenue refers to the total amount of money generated from the sale of goods or services. It is calculated before any expenses are subtracted. This is a crucial metric for determining the financial performance of a company.

2. Product SKUs (Stock Keeping Units)
   
Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) are unique identifiers assigned to each product or item in a company's inventory. SKUs help in tracking inventory, managing stock levels, and identifying products in the supply chain. Each SKU typically includes information about the product's attributes, such as size, color, and type.

3. Cost
   
Cost can refer to several types of expenditures: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): The direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including materials and labor.
Fixed Costs: Costs that do not vary with production levels, such as rent and salaries.
Variable Costs: Costs that vary directly with the level of production, such as raw materials and energy usage.

4. Selling Price
   
Selling price is the amount a customer pays for a product or service. It is determined by various factors, including production costs, desired profit margins, market demand, and competition.

5. Profit
   
Profit is the financial gain achieved when the revenue from sales exceeds the costs and expenses incurred in producing and selling the goods or services. It is calculated as:

<pre>
      Profit = SalesÂ Revenue âˆ’ TotalÂ Costs
 
     There are different types of profit:

    Gross Profit: Revenue minus COGS.
    Operating Profit: Gross profit minus operating expenses.
    Net Profit: Operating profit minus all other expenses, including taxes and interest.

6. Customer Company Names
   
Customer company names refer to the businesses or organizations that purchase products or services from a company. Keeping track of customer company names is important for managing relationships, sales processes, and customer service.

7. Traceability
 
Traceability is the ability to track the movement and history of products through various stages of production, processing, and distribution. It ensures that every product can be traced back to its source and throughout its lifecycle. Traceability is important for quality control, regulatory compliance, and addressing issues such as recalls.
